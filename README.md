# Building the Borrower Compass üó∫Ô∏è


## Introduction üë©‚Äçüíª
Hey, my name is Jazzy the Creator of this code! 

Are you a borrower? 

If yes, then great this is for you! 

If not, then congragulations you're about to learn the financial advice they didn't teach you in school but you wish you knew!

## Background üåÖ
We're ditching the dusty old loan approval methods and storming the frontier of peer-to-peer lending.

This project is about crafting a model so sophisticated, it can identify a borrower's creditworthiness with laser focus. We're talking cutting-edge techniques ‚Äì algorithms so sharp they'll separate the diamonds in the rough from the pretenders with surgical precision. Responsible lending fueling innovation, bad debt left whimpering in the corner ‚Äì that's the power we're wielding.

This is our opportunity to become the financial masters, ensuring **responsible risk management** while unleashing the potential of deserving borrowers. So, are you ready to step up and become the financial mastermind you were always meant to be? Let's do this.

## Analysis üîç
1. The model achieves near-perfect **precision (1.00)** for **healthy loans**, indicating it avoids classifying bad loans as good. However, the precision for high-risk loans (0.85) is lower. This suggests the model might be more likely to misclassify a good loan as risky (false positive) for high-risk loans compared to healthy loans.

2. Despite the potential for improvement with **high-risk loans**, the overall accuracy of 0.99 signifies a very strong model. It correctly classifies nearly all loans (both **healthy and risky**) in the test set.

3.  The recall values are high for both **healthy (0.99) and high-risk loans (0.91)**. This means the model misses very few actual **healthy** or **high-risk loans**, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying both types of loans.

## Happy Coding üéâ
